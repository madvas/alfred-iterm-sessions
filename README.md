# Alfred iTerm Sessions Workflow ([Download for iTerm2 2.1], [Download for iTerm2 2.9])
Alfred workflow to quickly select of one currently opened iTerm sessions

Just type “sessions” and it will show currently opened iTerm sessions. 
Optionally, you can type text to filter by session name, create new iTerm windows (iTerm2 2.9), or create new tabs in existing windows (iTerm2 2.9).

The iterm2.9-* applescripts are compatible with the [applescript changes](https://iterm2.com/applescript.html) introduced in Build 2.9.20150414.  They also add the ability to create new windows and new tabs in existing windows.
